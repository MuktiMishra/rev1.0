differnce betwwen library and framework
A library is a collection of functions and tools that you can call upon to perform specific tasks,
while a framework provides a structured way to build applications, often dictating the 
architecture and flow of the application.
library -> u can make changes
framework -> you have to follow the rules

React is a library or a framework?
React is considered a library because it primarily focuses on building user interfaces


What are routes?
Routes are the endpoints defined in a web application that determine how the application 
responds to client requests.
They map specific URLs to functions that handle the requests and generate responses.

app.use((req, res) => {
    res.status(404).send("Crazyyy Kiya Reee");
});  // middleware to handle 404 errors // if no route matches this is executed
// written at the end after all routes

Middleware
Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), 
the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the application's request-response cycle.
They can execute code, make changes to the request and response objects, 
end the request-response cycle, or call the next middleware function in the stack. 

why we need dynamic routes?
Dynamic routes allow web applications to handle a wide range of URLs and user requests
without needing to define a separate route for each possible URL.
They enable the creation of flexible and scalable applications that can respond to user-specific data,
such as profiles, products, or articles, by using parameters in the URL.

app.get('/products/:id', (req , res)=>{
    res.send(`Product id is in the url`);
})
// Start server
app.listen(4000, () => {
    console.log("Server started at port 4000");
});
 // u can use between port no 3000 to 8000 -> as they are not reserved by system

csr -> client side rendering , in this only data is sent from server to client , use api to send 
data to client 
ssr -> server side rendering , in this whole html page is sent from server to client
