Js Architecture 

1. Architecture
2. Event Loop
3. Browser runtime

// js is single-treaded but the os/server/browser is multi-treaded


// what is applets in java ??

// libuv - a c++ library 
(what livuv in node does?)
Ans: libuv is a cross-platform, open-source C library that provides the core
 infrastructure for Node.js's non-blocking, event-driven architecture. It acts as 
 the backbone that enables Node.js to perform asynchronous I/O operations efficiently, 
 even though JavaScript itself runs on a single thread.
