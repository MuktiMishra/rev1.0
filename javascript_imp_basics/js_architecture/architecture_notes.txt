Js Architecture 

1. Architecture
2. Event Loop
3. Browser runtime

//dev --> request --> |     |     __________    ____ async (non blocking)
                      |     | --> Event Loop --|
                      |     |     ___________   ____ sync
// js is single-treaded but the os/server/browser is multi-treaded


// what is applets in java ??

// libuv - a c++ library 
(what livuv in node does?)
Ans: libuv is a cross-platform, open-source C library that provides the core
 infrastructure for Node.js's non-blocking, event-driven architecture. It acts as 
 the backbone that enables Node.js to perform asynchronous I/O operations efficiently, 
 even though JavaScript itself runs on a single thread. 

 // Monolithic vs microservice archiecture
 -- explain
-- Monolithic Architecture:
A single, unified application where all components (UI, business logic, database access, etc.) 
are tightly coupled.
Example: A large e-commerce app where login, product catalog, cart, and payment all exist in one codebase.
-- Microservice Architecture:
The application is split into multiple independent services,
each handling a specific business function.
Each service can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
Example: The same e-commerce app split into User Service, Catalog Service, Payment Service, Order Service.

// Hoisting -- in javascript the variable declaration moves to the top thenafter that value assingnation
comes into picture 

console.log(a); // prints undefined
let a=5 ;
console.log(a); // prints 5

// splice and slice functions -- read and learn

arr = [1,2,3,,5] -- double comma throws no error
it means [1,2,3, empty, 5] 

arr.shift() -- removes 1st element of arr and returns it
arr = [2,3,,5]

arr.unshift() -- removes last element of arr abd returns it
arr=[2,3,]

empty!=null
arr[2]=null

// bitwise shift <<< , >>> (left shift , right shift)

//JSON.stringify(objecta) and JSON.parse(string)

// this keyword tries to acess the global varibales

let x=3;
function mfn(){
   let x=2;
   console.log(x); // prints 2
   console.log(x.this); // prints undefined
}
console.log(x); // prints 3

// const obj = {
    name:"mukti",
    age:20
}
// even its const but u can change the value 
// if u want that u can';t change value of objects later u can simply use freeze()

obj.freeze()

// read mdn docs
// let var const diff with code and edge cases
// too much chaos
// once you taste premium , ordinary's taste fades automatically 


// ASCII vs UNICODE 
// Validate user's email , pincode , password using  regex

//Node Js - a js runtime environment that uses v8 engine 
// it has modular achircture -> 2 types of modules ecmascript modules(esm)
esm loads modules asyncrously (Uses import to import modules.
Uses export to export functions, objects, or variables.)

2. is commonsjs modules(cjm)- loads modules syncrously (uses Uses require() to import modules.
Uses module.exports to export functions, objects, or variables.)
- only nodejs supports commonjs browser dont

// on what parameter we say a language is developed
the more concpts it covers it makes it more developed 
so when oops came in java c became mid leval in development

// live reload and hot reload
Feature 	          Hot Reloading	                    |         Live Reloading
App State	     Preserved (maintains current state)	|     Reset (loses current state)
Update Scope	Only injects changed modules	        |    Reloads the entire application
Speed	        Generally faster due to partial updates	|    Slower due to full restart
